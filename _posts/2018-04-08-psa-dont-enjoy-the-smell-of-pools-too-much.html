  <span class="smallcaps">The weather's improving</span> and that generally means barbecues, drinking fruity cocktails from hollowed-out coconuts, and of course, going to the local swimming pool.

  Fun fact: Chlorine and pee can also form cyanogen chloride, once considered for use in chemical warfare.

  When you get to the pool, the first thing you might notice is that typical smell of the chlorinated water. That smell is found in pools around the globe and as soon as that smell hits your nose you remember going to pools as a kid, cannonballing into the water because last one in is a rotten egg.

  Before you get too nostalgic though remember: that smell does not come from the chlorine in the water. That smell comes from trichloramine that forms when the chlorine reacts with pee.
