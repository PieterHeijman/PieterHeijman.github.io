<p class="lead">
	Singers are known to sometimes incorporate strange lyrics in their songs and 
	while they claim it&rsquo;s for poetic reasons, they&rsquo;re sometimes just wrong. Here 
	are some examples of wrong facts in songs.
</p>

<h2>Thunder</h2>
<p>
	According to Fleetwood Mac, you&rsquo;ll only hear thunder when it&rsquo;s raining. 
	Thunder is the sound caused by lightning-bolts, whose high temperature and 
	pressure expands the air around itself. This expansion causes a shock wave, which 
	is what you hear.
</p>
<p>
	Lightning is an electrical discharge. It&rsquo;s most common when clouds gain an 
	electrical charge and yes, in this case it&rsquo;s common for there to also be rain. 
	There are, however, also other ways for lightning to occur. Volcanic 
	eruptions for instance can also cause lightning strikes. Lightning is not  
	even limited to our moist little planet. Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are all known 
	to have lightning occur. Venus has no rainfall, except for sulphuric acid raining 
	in the upper atmosphere. Lightning on Venus is most likely caused by volcanic activity.
</p>
<h2>Gorilla Loving</h2>
<p>
	Think it&rsquo;s romantic to tell a girl you want to make love to her like Gorillas? 
	Even though female gorillas choose their mate, in groups with multiple males 
	female gorillas	can be forced to mate with multiple males during her period. I don&rsquo;t 
	think many women will go for that even after the alcohol and cocaine combo 
	Bruno Mars talks about doing.
</p>
<h2>Asian Bicycles</h2>
<p>
	In a Katie Melua song it is said that it&rsquo;s a fact that there are 9.000.000 bicycles in
	Beijing. Beijing is a large city with a population of 12.46 million people. Bikes are 
	extremely popular in China, where about 37% of the population owns a bike. So saying that 
	there are 9.000.000 bikes in Beijing is good guess. If 37% of the population own a 
	bike, then there are 4.610.200 bikes in Beijing. This might not be 9.000.000 bikes, but 
	it is a fair assumption that in a major city bike use is higher than in the countryside. 
	Having said that, it is definitely not a fact, but an estimate.
