**Title:** Attractors  
**2021**  
**Tools**: Processing  
**Concepts**: De Jong Attractors  

An experiment with De Jong Attractors. A single particle is placed on the screen. At its location a single white pixel is drawn. Using a variation of the De Jong attractor formula a new X and Y position is determined. The particle is moved to that position, where it draws a new pixel. This is repeated thousands of times to create the image.
