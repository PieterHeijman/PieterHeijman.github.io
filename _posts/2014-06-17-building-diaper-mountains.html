<p class="lead">Every now and then I drive up to the local recycling center, the trunk of my car filled with bags of diapers. Twins, right&hellip; At the recycling center you&rsquo;re supposed to show what you&rsquo;re dropping off, since not everything can be dropped off for free. Every time, the man checking the trash walks up to the car, sees the bags and jokes &ldquo;bringing over biochemical waste, huh?&rdquo;. I chuckle to humor him and go about my business.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Europe there are a total of 30.790.000 children under the age of 4, in the U.S. 20.140.000. On average a child goes through about 8.395 diapers in the first 4 years of its life. This totals up to about 64.620.512.500 diapers in Europe per year and 42.268.825.000 in the United States. If all those diapers get stacked up into a big pyramid, Europe would be able to build a diaper-pyramid 459.3 meters high every single year. The U.S. would have to do with a pyramid "merely" 398.7 meters high. That&rsquo;s still impressive, though. The Great Pyramid of Khufu in Giza is just 139 meters high. In fact, both the U.S. and European diaper-pyramids would take up a spot in the top 25 tallest buildings. The European diaper-pyramid would even manage to take up a top 10 spot.</p>

<p>My kids&rsquo; diapers all get recycled. And, judging from my calculations that&rsquo;s a good thing. Giant diaper-pyramids would just stink up the place.</p>
