*"Friendship" by Pieter Heijman*

**Title:** Friendship  
**2020**  
**Tools**: Processing  
**Concepts**: Particle systems  

"Friendship" is made up of a particle system. Each particle that appears draws lines to its closest neighbors for as long as it lives. When a particle dies, a new one is spawned semi-randomly. The colors tend to be dark red when a particle spawns on the left, dark green on the right. Because the colors are set to HSB, the longer particles live, the brighter the lines between them and their neighbors become.
