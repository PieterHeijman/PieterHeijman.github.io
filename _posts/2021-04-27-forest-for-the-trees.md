**Title:** Forest for the Trees  
**2020**  
**Tools**: Processing  
**Concepts**: Flow fields, noise  

"Forest for the Trees" is based on a Perlin noise flowfield, with the Perlin noise values rounded to limit the possible directions. Lines are drawn, following this flowfield. To create more natural looking lines, each control point in the line are moved a few pixels randomly. This causes a slight wobble.
