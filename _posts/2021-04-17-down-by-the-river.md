**Title**: Down by the River  
**2020**  
**Tools**: Processing  
**Concepts**: Flowfields, Noise

Last year I started experimenting with Processing, after hearing many great things about this library. Down by the River is one of the first more complicated drawings I've made in it. It uses a heavy layering of many semi-transparent lines to create the effect you see above. Each line is a curve that moves along a noise-based flowfield. Between each layer of lines, the flowfield is shifted slightly.
