<p class="lead">
    <span class="smallcaps">There&rsquo;s a bunch of great new music</span> that has come out recently. Below is an overview of the music I&rsquo;ve been enjoying a lot this past month. Heads up: this article links off to a lot of different music. Mostly the links lead to either Youtube or Spotify. 
</p>
<h2>Chali 2na</h2>
<p>
    Chali 2na has one of the deepest voices in hiphop and an excellent sense of rhythm to boot. He&rsquo;s one of the members of <a href="https://youtu.be/KeN9c2GYJkk" target="_blank">Jurassic 5</a> and once played <a href="https://youtu.be/8yis7GzlXNM" target="_blank">Neil deGrasse Tyson in Epic Rap Battles of History</a>. This summer he released this solid <a href="https://youtu.be/V0PM3NW6gzc" target="_blank">video with the Funk Hunters</a> and this week followed that up with a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2fiQkDKecJKrBpmdSmA3eq" target="_blank">song called <em>Get Involved</em></a>. Both songs have some great synthesizer sounds and strong beats. And Chali&rsquo;s vocals add a laid back feel to the songs (even though <em>Get Involved</em> is a rather uptempo song).
</p>
<h2>Soundtracks</h2>
<p>
    Talking about synthesizers, the soundtrack from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1puplOrvmUGoq2VxsB0ENJ" target="_blank">Stranger Things</a> came out. If you&rsquo;re into instrumental 80s synthesizer music, this is a must-listen. Just like the TV show, the soundtrack references music from the 80s a lot. But more than anything, I thought it sounded a lot like the soundtrack to the video game <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7us4WRnwvqCE3cppHVNjIu" target="_blank">FTL</a>.

    Lenzman&rsquo;s new album <em>All For You</em> is a direct callback to Drum and Bass music from the 90s.

<h2>More callbacks</h2>
<p>
    Where the Stranger Things soundtrack references the 80s, Lenzman&rsquo;s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7y2uxwxWG5cl0gdJLLpPwO" target="_blank">new album <em>All For You</em></a> is a direct callback to Drum and Bass music from the 90s. Fast paced rhythms combined with soulful piano&rsquo;s and synthesizers, topped off with the occasional vocals. All in all, it feels like the kind of Drum and Bass guys like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7CsHTewexhvufPnVsQtshJ" target="_blank">Goldie</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/42ra3RrOjoYtEIee6RijMn">Alex Reece</a> were making in the mid-nineties. 
</p>
<h2>More music from movies</h2>
<p>
    Besides new music, I&rsquo;ve also been going back to some older stuff. Mostly music from the <a href="https://youtu.be/qdbrIrFxas0" target="_blank">genius comedy <em>the Blues Brothers</em></a>. But also <a href="https://youtu.be/3iVdqpoyZs0" target="_blank">this opening tune</a> to a really cool French cartoon show, performed by <a href="https://youtu.be/_gq013-k7so" target="_blank">the Cure</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I leave you with <a href="https://youtu.be/jU6iP0WLsU8" target="_blank">this last song</a>, because it&rsquo;s coming up on the holiday season.
