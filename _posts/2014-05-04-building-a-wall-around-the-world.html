<p class="lead">Throughout the history of mankind, we&rsquo;ve been building walls. Short ones, like the walls that make up your home and long ones; Really, really long ones. Suppose, for some reason, we&rsquo;d want to build a wall that stretches around the world. Would that even be possible?</p>
<p>The Great Wall of China is the current record holder for longest wall in the world. It was built over a period of many centuries and basically served to protect the Chinese Empire against outside forces. It&rsquo;s actual length depends on what you&rsquo;re measuring. Its world record entry mentions a length 3.460 KM. That&rsquo;s just the main branch though. It also mentions 3.530 KM worth of branches. That&rsquo;s a total length of 6.990 KM. That&rsquo;s a long wall, but that&rsquo;s not all of the Great Wall of China. Part of the defensive structure were trenches and in some locations the natural landscape served as a wall. Adding all this to the actual brick structures and you come with a defensive structure well over 20.000 KM in length.</p>
<p>If we wanted to build a wall that goes around the world (and by that I mean a wall that goes around the earth at it&rsquo;s widest point, the Equator), 6.990 KM of wall won&rsquo;t cut it. We need 40.075 KM of wall. That&rsquo;s 5.7 times as much wall. And most of that wall would be built over water. Let&rsquo;s say our wall is 5 meters wide and 5 meters high. Our wall would be 1.001.875.000 M<sup>3</sup>. Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re using bricks that are 194 x 92 x 57 mm (a common size in the U.S. and very similar to sizes used around the world), we&rsquo;d need 9.84802x10<sup>11</sup> bricks. Let&rsquo;s say a single brick costs 0.25 cents, we&rsquo;d need at least 3.73 Bill Gates to pay for the bricks. And we&rsquo;re not even taking into account the many kilo&rsquo;s of sand needed to to fill up the parts of the oceans and seas the wall would cross.</p>
<p>Maybe, if we can&rsquo;t convince Bill Gates and several of his very wealthy friends to pay for a brick wall, we could go with a fence. Like Australia&rsquo;s Dingo Fence. That fence is about 5.614 KM long, so we&rsquo;d need only about seven times as much fence. Let&rsquo;s say, using 1m high coated (we need to cross the ocean, remember) chicken wire at &euro;40,- per 25 M, we&rsquo;d need about &euro;64.120.000,- to pay for the chicken wire. We also wouldn&rsquo;t need to fill up part of the ocean because we could easily fit our fence with floaters. Bill Gates could easily afford that.</p>
