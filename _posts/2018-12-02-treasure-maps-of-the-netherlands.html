  <span class="smallcaps">In the spring of 1574, an army of German mercenaries</span> led by the Dutch Louis and Henry of Nassau marched towards the Spanish troops led by Sancho d'Avila and Bernardino de Mendoza. It turned into one of the many bloody battles of the Eighty Years&rsquo; War. The Dutch suffered heavy losses, some 3000 soldiers died or were wounded and both Louis and Henry of Nassau died during the battle.

<h2>The legend of the war chest of Louis of Nassau</h2>
<aside class="right hidden-xs">A woman named &ldquo;Kiste Trui&rdquo; spent her life looking for the treasure. She lost her sanity in the process. A statue of her can be found in the area where the treasure is said to be hidden.</aside>
<p>
  This is where the legends begin. One legend surrounding this battle is that after the battle locals saw many lights floating over the fields. These were thought to be the souls of the fallen soldiers. The other legend is that of the war chest of Louis of Nassau. According to legend, when it looked like the mercenary troops were going to flee, Louis ordered the riches to be buried in an iron chest.

  The treasure was supposedly found a century later by a poacher. But the man who found it was confronted by a small red man, a devil, who guarded the treasure. The red man mocked the poacher and pulled the treasure deeper underground.
