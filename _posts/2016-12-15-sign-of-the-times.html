    <span class="smallcaps">I came across this sign</span> during a dog walk earlier this week. The sign, a simple laminated print-out tacked to a sign post near a local river, shows just one of the many ways climate change impacts our environment.

    Translated the first paragraph reads: <em>&ldquo;Due to climate change the amount of water in our rivers increases and with it the chance of floods. To make sure the water can drain into the sea unobstructed, the department of public works in consultation with nature management organizations like Stiching het Limburgs Landschap created the program Streamline.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p>
    The remaining paragraphs go into details. Program Streamline involves the removal of trees and bushes that block the river&rsquo;s path. This should increase the amount of grassland and improve the flow of the river.
