**Title:** Deep  
**2021**  
**Tools**: Processing  
**Concepts**: Cohen-Sutherland clipping  

Something quite different than the flowfields and Perlin noise used in my other recent drawings. "Deep" is made up of blocks of lines clipped using the Cohen-Sutherland clipping algorithm. The angles of the lines are random and to break up the grid, at random intervals a larger block is drawn. The colors are chosen semi-random from sets of deep blue colors to create a gradient.
