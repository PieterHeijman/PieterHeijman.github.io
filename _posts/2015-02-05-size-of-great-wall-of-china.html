	The Great Wall of China is huge, the entire wall with all of its branches
	combined measures 21.196 km. If you could put all of those branches in a
	single file, it would go more than halfway across the Earth. It is not 
	strange that all around the world Chinese restaurants are named after it.

	It is pretty hard to get a good number, but searching through the Yellow Pages 
	for several countries comes up with about 1 restaurant named after the Great 
	Wall per 300.000 people. At least in Europe and North America (getting numbers 
	for the rest of the world is limited by my ability, or rather my lack of ability, to speak foreign languages, 
	sorry). That means Europe and North America combined have a total of about 
	3890 restaurants named after the Great Wall. If an average restaurant is about 
	15 meters long (looking at local restaurants, this seems like a decent guess), 
	putting all these restaurants in a single file would build a wall of almost 
	60 km long. Nowhere near the 21.196 km of the actual Great Wall.

	Even if the entire world had 1 Chinese restaurant named after the Great Wall per 
	300.000 people, the restaurant wall would only be 350 km long. If that wall started 
	in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, it would pass through Belgium and end up in 
	Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.
</p>
<p>
	If the current	population growth stays stable and the amount of 
	restaurants named after the	Great Wall would grow accordingly, our wall of 
	restaurants would not outgrow the actual Great Wall of China for another 5000 years. 
</p>
<p>
	There is a reason why the Great Wall of China is considered to be one of the 
	wonders of the world. It is an absolutely massive work of engineering that the 
	restaurant business will not be able to meet (yet).
