<h1>About Trivial Discourse</h1>
<article>
	<p>Hi, my name is Pieter and I'm a software engineer from the Netherlands. Because my wife is getting sick of me constantly blurting out silly factoids, this site is to become my outlet for trivial information. If there is anything you'd like me to research for you, just let me know.</p>
	<p>Obviously with a wife, two kids and a job (and maybe a slight addiction to videogames) I only have so much time to work on this site. This means I can't add a new post every day, but also that I have limited time to do background-checks and to properly check my math. If you notice a mistake, <a href="/contact.jsp">please let me know</a> and I will fix the mistake (if I feel you're right).</p>
