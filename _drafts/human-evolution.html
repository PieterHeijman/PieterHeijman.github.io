<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Let's start at the beginning, some 4000 million years ago. At this point the first single cell organisms appeared. These are among the most basic lifeforms you could possibly imagine, but instrumental for all life that followed. The Earth didn't have oxygen in its atmosphere at the time of the early single cell organisms. However, early Cyanobacteria fed themselves via photosynthesis. This released O<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere and slowly but surely turned the Earth into a planet where life could become abundant.</p>
<p>We make a jump to about 1200 million years ago. Single cell organisms where becoming more and more complex. It is at this point that sexual reproduction appeared which increased the speed of evolution significantly.</p>
