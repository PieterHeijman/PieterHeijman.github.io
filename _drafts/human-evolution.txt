We humans have been around for about â€¦ years. From the prehistoric humans, inventing wheels and making cave paintings, to today's modern people looking at our smart phones while stuck in traffic. But it's not like we suddenly appeared out of nowhere. We humans have been al sorts of things before we became humans. It is not hard to imagine we were once monkey's, but fish or worms? Let's have a look at what it took to get to what we are today.

The beginning

About 4000 Ma (Ma stands for megaannus, or 1 million years) ago the earth looked incredibly inhabitable. For one the atmosphere contained just a small amount of oxygen, mostly in the form of water vapour. In this inhabitable world the first signs of life appeared. At 3900 Ma these early building blocks start to form single cell organisms. These early lifeforms didn't require oxygen like most life does today. In stead they fed through photosynthesis. This process sets in motion an event referred to as the "Great Oxygenation Event", severely increase the amount of oxygen in the air. The larger amount of oxygen enables life to become more complex and at about 1200 Ma ago the first organisms start to reproduce via sexual reproduction, significantly increasing the speed of evolution.
