Dinosaur Revolution

In 1868 Thomas Henry Huxley suggested that maybe birds were direct descendants of dinosaurs. This idea did not get a foothold and was ultimately abandoned. It wasn't until the 1970's when the idea was revisited. Today we can say with quite some certainty that birds are in fact dinosaurs. It's interesting to see that a topic that has literally gone extinct millions of years ago there is still topical. Today we're looking at how our ideas of dinosaurs changed in the past few decades.

Big giant chickens

So now that we know that birds are dinosaurs, can we also assume dinosaurs were birds. When you think about what a dinosaur looks like "bird-like" is probably not what you're thinking about. You're probably imagining a big scaly reptile; green, big sharp teeth, a long smooth tail (perhaps with some spikes on the end). Most likely your picture of a dinosaur does not contain any feathers. Not every dinosaur had feathers, but a lot of them did. These feathers were fairly primitive structures, but feathers non the less. The idea that dinosaurs had feathers started in the 1970's. It wasn't until the 1990's, when several fossils were discovered showing feather-like structures, that the idea became popular.

Non-existant dinosaurs

New dinosaurs

There are new fossils being found on a regular basis, so it's to no surprise that new species of dinosaurs are being found from time to time as well. Like two Sauropods found in the past few years. Sauropods tend to be large creatures. These two dinosaurs, Zby atlanticus and L. laticauda, are at either end of the size spectrum for Sauropods. Zby atlanticus is downright huge at 20 meters. L. laticauda is, at least for a Sauropod, fairly small at 9 meters. Also uncovered recently is a dinosaur named Torvosaurus gurneyi, another giant. This bipedal predator was about 10 meters tall and weighed in at about a metric ton. This dinosaur, found in Portugal, is Europe's largest predatorial dinosaur. These giant creatures have spent  about 150 million buried in the dirt. One can only imagine the kind of behemots still resting in the Earth's crust.
